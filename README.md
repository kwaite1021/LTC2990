# LTC2990
Raspberry Pi 3 driver for LTC2990 IC
This is a power monitor IC - you can measure voltage, shunt current and remote temperature using a transistor. The binary is also included if you do not wish to compile. The dependencies are gcc++ and WiringPi both of which are included in the Raspbian distribution. I will provide a development board if anyone is interested, email me here or at career4KW@gmail.com
Thanks,
Kevin
