# LTC2990
Raspberry Pi3 I2C driver for LTC2990 IC
This is a power monitor IC - you can measure voltage, shunt current and remote temperature using a transistor. The binary is also included if you do not wish to compile. The dependencies are gcc++ and WiringPi both of which are included in the Raspbian distribution. I will provide a development board with header pins for breadboard if anyone is interested, contact me here or at career4KW@gmail.com
I plan to use my previous Raspberry PI Node web server to put the ltc2990 data on the web using the Pi as the node server.This will be included here when completed.
Thanks,
Kevin
